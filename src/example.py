# brief- this script is used to request location data from hologram.io and incorporate that data into our MongoDB database
# Right now, the data is being sent to my own personal database, but the data can be easily redirected with a different 
# connection string. 
#
# As of now, this will be stored in a single "location" collection. Will not search and update existing packets in entire database
# however, it will timestamp the last time it was updated, as well as store an array of past locations with their respective 
# timestamps 
#
